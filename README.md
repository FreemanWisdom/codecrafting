# CodeCrafting


**CodeCrafting** is a web solutions and education brand focused on building fast, clean, and modern websites while teaching practical web development skills.


This project represents the **Version 1 (MVP)** of the CodeCrafting website — a one-page, performance-focused startup site designed to clearly communicate services, learning goals, and brand credibility.

## Project Status


This is an **early-stage build**.

Transparency is intentional — nothing here is faked or overstated.
